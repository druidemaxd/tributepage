        <h2>Here's an historical of user story</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1998 : </strong>Alistair Cockburn visited the Chrysler C3
            project in Detroit and coined the phrase "A user story is a promise
            for a conversation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1999 : </strong>Kent Beck published the first edition of the
            book Extreme Programming Explained, introducing Extreme Programming
            (XP),and the usage of user stories in the planning game.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2001 : </strong>Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula
            for user story creation: The Card (or often a post-it note) is a
            tangible physical token to hold the concepts; The Conversation is
            between the stakeholders (customers, users, developers, testers,
            etc.). It is verbal and often supplemented by documentation; The
            Confirmation ensures that the objectives of the conversation have
            been reached.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2001 : </strong>The XP team at Connextra in London devised
            the user story format and shared examples with others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2004 : </strong>Mike Cohn generalized the principles of user
            stories beyond the usage of cards in his book User Stories Applied:
            For Agile Software Development that is now considered the standard
            reference for the topic according to Martin Fowler.Cohn names Rachel
            Davies as the inventor of user stories.While Davies was a team
            member at Connextra she credits the team as a whole with the
            invention.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2014 : </strong>After a first article in 2005 and a blog
            post in 2008, in 2014 Jeff Patton published the user-story mapping
            technique, which intends to improve with a systematic approach the
            identification of user stories and to structure the stories to give
            better visibility to their interdependence.
